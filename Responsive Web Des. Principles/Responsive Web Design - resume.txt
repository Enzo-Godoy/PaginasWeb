Media query 
Media quieries are a nem technique introduced in CSS3 that change the presentation of content based on different viewport sizes. 
The viewport is a user's visible are of a web page, and is different depending on the device used to access the site. 

Media queries consist of a media type, and if that media type, and if thart media type matches the type of device the document is displayed on, the styles are applied. 
We can have as many sleectors and styles indside our media query as we want. 


Ex 

@media(max-width : 100px ) { /* CSS Rules */} 
-- A media query that returns the content when the device's width is lees that or equal to 100px. 

Another example  

@media (min-height : 350px) {/* CSS Rules*/} 
The followinf media query returns the content when the device's height is more than or equal to 350px. 


-- The CSS inside the media query is applied only if the media type matches that of the device being used. 

@media (max-height:800px) {font-size:10p}


Making images responsive with csss. 
Instead of applying an absolute width to an element . 

ex: 
img{width:720px;} 


We can use : 

img { 
max-width:100%; 
display:block; 
height:auto;
}


The max-width property of 100% scales the image to fit the width of its container, but the image won't stretch wider that its original width. 
Setting the display property  to block changes the image from an inline element(its default), to a block element on its own line. The height property of auto keeps the original aspect ratio of the image. 




Using a retina image for higher resolution displays. 

The simplest way to make our images appear  "retina"(and optimize them for retina displays)is to define their width and height values as only half of what the original file is. 


Ex : 

<style> 
  img { height: 250px; width:250px; } 
</style> 
<img src="coolPic500x500" alt="A most excellent picture"> 


Make Typography responsive 
Instad of using em or px to size text, we can use viewport units for responsive typoghraphy, Viewport units, like percentges, are relative units, but they are based off different items. 
Viewport units are relative to the viewport dimensions(width or lheight9 of a device, and percentages are relative to the size of the parent container element). 

The four differen viewport units are : 

*vw. 
*vh
*vmin
*vmax. 

vw - 10 wv would be 10% of the viewport's with.

vh - 3vh would be 3% of the vieÂ´wport's height. 

vmin - 70min would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension(height vs. width). 

vmax : 100max would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension(height vs. width).
