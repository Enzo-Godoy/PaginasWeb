We need to keep in mind when we are developing our proyect, to make  an open web. 

Three general concepts:

* Have well-organized code that uses appropiate markup. 
2 - Ensure text alternatives exist for non.text and visual content. 
3 - Create an easily-navigated page that's keyboard-friendly. 

The check it out we use  W3 Consortium's Web Content Accesibility Guidelines (WCAG). 
 They set the international standard for accesibility and provide a number of criteria.




 In situatuions when an image is already explained with text content, or does not add meaning to a page, the img still neeeds an alt attribute, but it can be set to an empty string.
