HTML5 introduced the figure element, with  figcaption.
 Used together, these items wrap a visual representation,
 along with its caption. This gives a two-fold accessibility by both semantically grouping related content, and providing a text alternative that explains the figure.


For data visualizations like charts, the caption can be used to briefly note the trends or conclusions for users with visual impairments.
