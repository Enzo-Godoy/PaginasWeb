The repeatin-linear-gradient() function is very similar to linear-gradient() with the major difference that it repeats the specified gradient pattern. 

The angle value is the direction of the gradient color stops are like width values that mark where transition takes places, and are given with a percentage or a number of pixels. 

//It helps to think about the color stops as pairs where every two colors blend together. 

If every two color stop values are the same color, the blending isn't noticeavle beacuse it's between the same color, followed by a hard transition to the next color, so you end up with stripes.


To add texture and interest to a background and have it stand out more is to add a subtle pattern. 

Attention with the background to stant out too much, and take away from the foregrounf. 
//The background  property supports the url()function in order to link to an image of the chosen texture or pattern.
    The link address is wrapped in quotes inside the parentheses.




    Use the css transform scale property to change the size of an Element. 

    To Change the scale of an element, CSS has the transform property, along with its scale()function. 

    Example : 

    element { 
      transforma:scale(n);
    }




    All the transforma property has a variety of function that lest us scale, move, rotate, skew, etc. our elements.


    Use the css transform property skewX to Skew an Element Along the X-Axis. 
    Wich skews the selected element alogn its X (horizontal) axis by a given degree. 


    Example 

    element {
      transform : skewX($deg/-&deg);
    }


    Also we got the skewY() - function 
      wich skews an element along the Y (vertical) axis.

    element { 
      transform: skewY($deg/-&deg);
    }



    Create a Graphic Using Css 
    By manipulating different selectors and properties, we can make interesting shapes. 
    One of the easier ones ro try is a crescent moon shape. 
     Here w'll be useing  box-shadown and the border-radous property. 


     We w'll create a round, transparent object with a crisp shadow that is slightly offset to the side- the shadow is actually going to be the moon shape. 

     In order to create a round object, the border.radius properrt should be set to a value od 50%. 

     Remember tjat the box-shadown property takes values for 
       *off-set -x ,
       *off-set -y ,
       *blur-radius ,
       *spread-radius.  

    //The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.
